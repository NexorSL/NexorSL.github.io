    <h1>Privacy Policy for Level Tracker</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Level Tracker! This privacy policy outlines our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information when you use our app. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you have a positive experience while using Level Tracker.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>Our app, Level Tracker, does not store personal information in a database. However, we generate and collect logs for operational purposes. Each user is assigned a unique identifier (userId), which does not hold any personal data. The logs include these userIds along with data such as the date and time of activity, version of the app, and performance metrics. This information helps us monitor app functionality, identify and resolve issues, and improve user experience.</p>

    <h2>Purpose of Data Collection</h2>
    <p>The logs are collected solely to enhance the functionality and user experience of Level Tracker. They allow us to maintain the performance of the app, track usage patterns, and make ongoing improvements.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All collected logs are stored on servers located in Finland. These logs are kept for a period of up to one year, after which they are permanently deleted to ensure your privacy.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not share any data collected by Level Tracker with third parties. However, it is important to note that we use Expo, a framework and platform for universal React applications, which assists in the overall functionality and maintenance of the app.</p>

    <h2>User Rights</h2>
    <p>As Level Tracker does not collect or store personal data, users do not need to worry about accessing, correcting, or deleting personal information. Our practices ensure that your privacy is automatically protected by design.</p>

    <h2>Security Measures</h2>
    <p>Since no personal data is stored, specific security measures related to user data storage are not applicable to Level Tracker. We focus on maintaining the integrity and security of the app itself.</p>

    <h2>Changes to the Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time. Should any changes be made, a notification will be displayed via a dialog within the app which must be accepted before you can continue using the app.</p>

    <h2>Contact Information</h2>
    <p>For any privacy-related questions or concerns, please contact us via email at <a href="mailto:xd.com">mutianov.o.o@gmail.com</a>.</p>
